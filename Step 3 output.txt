Heart Attack
BY M.S.H

--- Slide 2 ---
What is a heart Attack? 
when blood flow is blocked from reaching part of the heart • prevents sufficient oxygen from reaching heart • causes heart muscle to become damaged or die • also known as myocardial infarction


--- Slide 3 ---
What are the Causes? 
Heart attacks are caused by: • blood clots blocking the coronary arteries • this stops blood flow and heart cells die • clot forms because coronary arteries becomes narrowed by plaque (atherosclerosis) • plaque cracks and triggers clot • less commonly from blood vessel problems and severe coronary artery spasm • spasm could be related to drugs, stress, smoking

Diabetes 
Family history of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) High fat diet Race: higher risk in African Americans, Mexican Americans, Native Americans, and Native Hawaiians High blood pressure Increasing age Smoking Unhealthy cholesterol levels Lack of exercise Stress Sex: men over 45, women over 55 Am I at Risk? Risk Factors

Shortness of breath 
Loss of consciousness Perspiration Severe crushing pain Tightness or squeezing in chest (Angina) Pain possibly spreading to left arm, shoulder, neck or jaw Light-headedness Many attacks begin slowly with mild pain May feel like heartburn/indigestion Nausea and vomiting How do I know if I am having a Heart Attack? Symptoms DO NOT IGNORE SYMPTOMS!

Diagnosing a Heart Attack 
• Physician uses stethoscope to find abnormal heart rhythms/sounds • Check pulse and blood pressure • Electrocardiograms (ECG) detect irregular heart beat (arrhythmia) or blocked coronary artery • Blood tests • High level of cardiac enzymes indicate damaged heart muscle • CK (creatine kinase), MB (myoglobin) and troponin released from damaged heart muscle (proteins)


--- Slide 7 ---
Treating a Heart Attack Victim
• While heart attack is occurring: • Take aspirin at home to help dissolve clot • Ambulance/Doctors will administer clot busters such as streptokinase and nitrates • Surgery may be needed to clear/open arteries • Put on oxygen • CPR may be needed or defibulation to restore heart beat • Morphine administered • Relieves pain, sedates, and reduces oxygen demand


--- Slide 8 ---
After person is stabilized:
• Thrombolytic Therapy • Medicine given to dissolve blood clots • Beta- Blockers • Decrease workload for heart, relieve pains, and correct arrhythmia • ACE (angiotensin-converting enzymes) inhibitors • Lower blood pressure, reduce strain for heart • Anticoagulents • Thin blood and prevent clots from forming • Antiplatelet Medicine • Stop platelets from clumping together


--- Slide 9 ---
More Advanced Treatments
• Angioplasty • Open coronary arteries • Catheter with balloon is threaded through blood vessel to blocked artery • Balloon then inflates pushing plaque aside • Doctors sometimes place a stent in the artery • Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting • Arteries or veins are taken from other parts of the body to bypass arteries • These arteries/veins are then sewn in place • Open-heart surgery could be required if heart ruptures


--- Slide 10 ---
Rehabilitation
• Discharged from hospital after a week at earliest • Activites slowly increase over 8 weeks • Resume full schedule after 2 months out of the hospital • Long term treatment with beta-blockers and aspirin • Drugs to lower cholesterol are given • Badly damaged heart requires warfarin (anticoagulent) for 3 months


--- Slide 11 ---
Facts
• 40% of heart attacks are fatal • Half of these deaths occur in first hour • Over 1.1 million heart attacks in United States each year • One of the leading killers in America • Males have higher risks for heart attacks
