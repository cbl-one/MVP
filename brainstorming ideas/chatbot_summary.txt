 *  ** What  is  a  Heart  Attack ? ** 
     *    Block age  of  blood  flow  to  the  heart  muscle 
     *    Insufficient  oxygen  delivery ,  leading  to  damage  or  death  of  heart  tissue 
     *    Also  known  as  My ocardial  In far ction 

 *  ** Causes  of  Heart  Attacks :** 
      *  Blood  clots  blocking  coronary  arteries  ( usually  due  to  atherosclerosis ) 
      *  Plaque  in  arteries  can  crack  and  trigger  clot  formation   
      *  Other  less  common  causes :  blood  vessel  problems ,  severe  coronary  artery  spasm 

 *  ** Am  I  at  Risk ? ** 
     *    Risk  factors  include  diabetes ,  family  history  of  CAD ,  high  fat  diet ,  smoking ,  high  BP ,  unhealthy  cholesterol  levels ,  lack  of  exercise ,  stress ,  age  ( men  over   4 5 ,  women  over   5 5 ) 

 *  ** Symptoms  of  a  Heart  Attack :** 
     *  Short ness  of  breath 
     *  Loss  of  consciousness 
     *  Pers piration 
     *  Severe  crushing  pain  in  the  chest  ( Ang ina ),  possible  spreading  to  left  arm ,  shoulder ,  neck  or  jaw 
     *  Light - headed ness 
     *  Nausea  and  vomiting 

 *  ** Diagnos ing  a  Heart  Attack ** 
      *    Phys icians  utilize  stethoscope  for  abnormal  heart  rhythms / sounds   
      *    Pulse  &  blood  pressure  check 
      *    Electro cardio grams  ( ECG )  detect  irregular  heart  beats 
      *    Blood  tests :  high  levels  of  cardiac  enzymes  indicate  damaged  muscle . 

 *  ** Treating  a  Heart  Attack :** 
      *    Asp irin  to  dissolve  clots  while  the  attack  is  occurring . 
      *    C lot - bust ing  drugs  like  strepto kinase  and  nitrates  administered  through  ambulance  or  doctor . 
      *    Surgery  may  be  necessary  to  clear / open  blocked  arteries .   
      *    Oxygen ,  CPR ,  def ib rillation  if  needed 

 *  ** After  Stabilization :** 
      *  Throm b olytic  Therapy  ( blood  clot  dissolving  medication ) 
      *  Beta - block ers :  lower  heart  workload ,  relieve  pains  and  correct  arrhyth mia . 
      *  ACE  inhibitors :  lower  blood  pressure ,  reduce  strain  on  the  heart . 
      *  An tico ag ulents :  thin  blood  to  prevent  clots .   
      *  Anti plate let  medicines :  stop  platelets  from  clump ing  together . 

 *  ** More  Advanced  Treatments ** 
      *  Ang iop lasty  ( Balloon  dilation  of  blocked  arteries )  followed  by  st enting  if  needed . 
      *  Coronary  Ar tery  Bypass  Gra fting  ( surgical  rer outing  of  blood  flow ) 
      *  These  procedures  can  require  open - heart  surgery 


 *  ** Re habilitation :** 
      *  Discharge  from  hospital  after  a  week  at  earliest .

      *  Resume  full  schedule  after   2  months  out  of  the  hospital .   
      *  Long  term  treatment  with  beta - block ers  and  aspirin . 
      *  Medications  to  lower  cholesterol  and  control  diabetes . 

 *  ** Facts :** 
     *    4 0 %  of  heart  attacks  are  fatal ,  half  in  first  hour 
     *    Over   1 . 1  million  heart  attacks  in  the  US  each  year 
     *    Leading  killer  in  America
