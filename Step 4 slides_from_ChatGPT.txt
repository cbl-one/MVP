**BY M.S.H**

### **Slide 2**  
**Theoretical Case: Mr. Johnson's Emergency**  
- Mr. Johnson, a 56-year-old male, collapses at work.  
- Symptoms: Severe chest pain, tightness in the chest, sweating, and light-headedness.  
- History: High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking.  
- Objective: Identify the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment for his condition.

### **Slide 3**  
**What is a Heart Attack?**  
- Blood flow blocked to part of the heart.  
- Prevents oxygen from reaching the heart.  
- Causes damage or death of heart muscle.  
- Also known as myocardial infarction.

---

### **Slide 4**  
**What are the Causes?**  
- Blood clots blocking coronary arteries.  
- Plaque buildup (atherosclerosis).  
- Plaque cracks, triggering clots.  
- Other causes:  
  - Blood vessel problems.  
  - Severe coronary artery spasm (linked to drugs, stress, smoking).

### **Slide 5**  
**Am I at Risk? Risk Factors**  
- **Health Conditions**:  
  - Diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol.  
- **Lifestyle**:  
  - Smoking, lack of exercise, stress, high-fat diet.  
- **Demographics**:  
  - Increasing age, family history of CAD.  
  - Higher risk for men over 45 and women over 55.  
  - Higher prevalence in certain races (e.g., African Americans, Native Americans).

### **Slide 6**  
**Symptoms: How to Recognize a Heart Attack**  
- Severe crushing pain or chest tightness (Angina).  
- Pain spreading to left arm, shoulder, neck, or jaw.  
- Shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting.  
- Light-headedness, loss of consciousness, or perspiration.  
- May feel like heartburn or indigestion.  
- **DO NOT IGNORE SYMPTOMS!**

---

### **Slide 7**  
**Diagnosing a Heart Attack**  
- Physical examination: Stethoscope, pulse, blood pressure.  
- Electrocardiogram (ECG): Detect arrhythmias or blockages.  
- Blood tests:  
  - High levels of cardiac enzymes (CK, MB, troponin).  

---

### **Slide 8**  
**Treating a Heart Attack Victim**  
- At home: Take aspirin to dissolve clots.  
- Ambulance/Doctor actions:  
  - Clot busters (e.g., streptokinase, nitrates).  
  - Oxygen and pain management (morphine).  
  - CPR or defibrillation if necessary.  
  - Surgery to clear/open arteries.

---

### **Slide 9**  
**Stabilization and Medical Management**  
- **Thrombolytic Therapy**: Dissolves clots.  
- **Beta-Blockers**: Reduce heart workload and correct arrhythmias.  
- **ACE Inhibitors**: Lower blood pressure and strain.  
- **Anticoagulants**: Thin blood and prevent clots.  
- **Antiplatelet Medication**: Prevent platelet clumping.

---

### **Slide 10**  
**More Advanced Treatments**  
- **Angioplasty**:  
  - Balloon opens blocked arteries.  
  - May involve stent placement.  
- **Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)**:  
  - Arteries/veins from other parts of the body bypass blocked arteries.  
  - Open-heart surgery if heart ruptures.

---

### **Slide 11**  
**Rehabilitation and Recovery**  
- Discharge after a week (minimum).  
- Gradual increase in activities over 8 weeks.  
- Resume normal schedule in 2 months.  
- Long-term medications:  
  - Beta-blockers, aspirin, cholesterol-lowering drugs.  
  - Warfarin for severely damaged hearts.

---

### **Slide 12**  
**Heart Attack Facts**  
- 40% of heart attacks are fatal.  
- Half of deaths occur in the first hour.  
- Over 1.1 million heart attacks annually in the U.S.  
- One of the leading causes of death.  
- Males have a higher risk.

---

### **Slide 13**  
**Prevention: Reducing Your Risk**  
- Avoid smoking.  
- Eat a healthy, low-fat, low-salt diet.  
- Control blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol.  
- Exercise regularly.  
- Manage stress and maintain a healthy weight.
